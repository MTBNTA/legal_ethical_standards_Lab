Scenario 1:
- As BankingCorp is updating its terms and conditions with the information of the partnership and the algorithm testing, the proposal may not be breaking any laws.

- Customers that already struggle with their finances may be targeted unfairly by the emails from the payday loan company. If they are not fully informed on the terms and conditions of a loan they may find themselves in more financial difficulties as a result.

- BankingCorp could be more transparent with its collaboration with the payday loan company. Although, the have updated their terms and conditions sent in an email, most people will not read the full terms and conditions before consenting to them as they most likely know. The new partnership could be announced more publicly and the customers could have to consent to having their data used for testing the algorithm.


Scenario 2:
- As long as a player if informed that they will be making a purchase with real-world money before they do so, the Treasure Hunters game is not breaking the law.

- An ethical concern is that they could be making the game addictive with their new features and people who struggle with gambling and other related issues may be more susceptible to spending their money.

- The company could make sure that features that are available to be purchased in the game are only purchased by adults.


Scenario 3
- friends.com could be breaking the law as the private data of its users does not seem to be kept very securely. Having users location and areas that they frequently visit visible for anyone who has the app could be very dangerous. Additionally, sharing a users' data with local businesses for monetary gains without consent could be breaking the law.

- An ethical concern with the company's proposal is that loyal customers who had access freely to services before now have to pay for the same experience. This could cause people who have used the app for a while to leave.

- The advertising of the premium services and the pop-up adds could be have a cross on them for the user to minimise the adds when they are using the app.
